  <h2>Stitchify</h2>
  <p> Ever wanted a cross-stitched picture of your face? </p>

  <p> Yeah, me too. That's why I made Stitchify! </p>

  <p> Stitchify takes a picture you select and turns it into a cross-stitch pattern! It's still a work in progress (accepting PRs <a href="https://github.com/ln1draw/stitchify" target="__blank" alt="github repo for the project">here</a>) but it's pretty fun! Select a width in number of squares and a picture and check it in action!</p>

  <p><h5>A note on privacy:</h5></p>
  <p>No picture you submit is saved while generating the cross-stitch pattern. That being said, there are a lot of malicious people out there, and frankly, this is a fun project I do in my free time; I'm not devoting much time or thought to security. I do not recommend that you stitchify anything sensitive, because, you know, the internet!</p>
