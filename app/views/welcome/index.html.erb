  <h2>Hi there!</h2>
  <p>I'm Ellen. I'm a human who lives in eastern Washington. Professionally, I write code. I care a lot about my customers' needs, and I believe in using good engineering practices to support these needs. You can never write perfect code, but you can build a robust system that uses smart processes to find problems before they reach your end user.</p>
  <p>In my personal life, I like to express my creative side. I create music, paint, knit, cross-stitch...I've tried most fiber arts that I've heard of. I have two very small cats and two very large dogs, and they're all named after fighter pilots on the Battlestar Galactica, because I'm a big nerd too.</p>
  <p>This is my personal website. It's not much, but it's mine.</p>
